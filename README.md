## Abstract

This project was conducted as part of an agility course at Paris Dauphine University.
It is not necessarily a very great coherence because the goal was precisely to project into an Ireel world.
However, the "real" inconsistency does not prevent developing a high quality project.
We find thus:

- ABC
- Unit tests
- Code coverage
- Linter (pylint)
- Design Patterns
- Static typing (mypy)
- Formater (black and isort)
- Functional tests (with cucumber and behave)

This project consists of two packages:

1. `cars`
2. `foods`

The link between these two packages reside in the fact that a car can sell food (the Foodtruck concept)
